### A collection of algorithms in preparation for interviews

This is mostly done to have a toolbelt of implementations in my head so we at least can make traction on most problems.

I'm using this in tandem with leetcode/interview cake, so a natural place to take notes is right here:

I'm not too impressed with InterviewCake -- their tests aren't very polished. The editor isn't polished either.

One section lambasts array slicing -- but doesn't mention subList at all (which circumvents all issues with array slices)
